## ToDo Templates

### Base Template (`base.html`)

The base template provides a foundation for the application's layout and design, including the navigation bar, footer, and main content area. It uses Bootstrap for styling and layout, and includes custom CSS for additional design elements.

#### Meta Content:

- **Character Encoding:** The character encoding standard used in the template is set to UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters and languages.
- **Bootstrap Framework:** This is a widely-used CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first interfaces.
- **Custom CSS:** The custom CSS stylesheet ('static/css/style.css') is used to visualy expand and enhance beyond bootstrap.
- **Fonts:** The font families used in the template are the Google fonts Roboto and Konkhmer Sleokchher, providing a clean and modern typography.

#### Navigation Bar:

The navigation bar is a critical component of the base template, providing links to essential pages and features of the application. It includes:

- **Login and Register Links:** Links to the login and register pages, allowing users to access their accounts or create new ones.
- **Logout Link:** A link to logout of the application, available only when the user is logged in.
- **Username Display:** The navigation bar displays the username of the logged-in user, providing a personalised experience.

#### Main Content:

The main content area displays:

- **Alert Messages:** Alert messages are displayed to provide feedback to the user. These messages are shown near the top of the card, ensuring they are visible without the need for scrolling. They are automatically dismissed after five seconds.
- **Primary UI Content:** Primary content from other HTML files is served below this.

#### Script References:

The base template includes references to the following scripts:

- **Bootstrap JavaScript Files:** The template includes references to Bootstrap's JavaScript files, which provide functionality for components such as dropdowns, modals, and tooltips.
- **Custom JavaScript Code:** The template also includes custom JavaScript code, which provides functionality for task management features, such as toggling task statuses and updating the task list.


### Main Page Template (todo_list.html)

The todo_list.html template serves as the main page of the application, displaying the user's task list and providing features for task management.

#### Meta Content:

- Extends the `base.html` template to ensure a consistent layout and styling across the entire application.
- Utilizes `{% load static %}` to load static files.

#### Content:

The todo_list.html template displays the following content:

- **Task Form:** The template includes a form for adding new tasks, allowing users to create new tasks and add them to their task list.
- **Task List:** The template displays the user's task list, including task names, statuses, and actions (delete).
- **Task Status Toggle:** The template provides a button for toggling task statuses, allowing users to easily update the status of their tasks.
    - If a task is not started the button will appear grey
    - If a task is in progress the button will appear orange
    - When a task is completed the button will appear green
- **Task Actions:** The template includes an action for deleting tasks, allowing users to remove tasks.


## ToDo Model

The toDo model is used to represent the tasks within the ToDo Genie Pro Django application. Below is an outline of the model's primary attributes and features:

### Fields:

The ToDo model includes the following fields to store and manage tasks, while associating them with a user:

- **id:** A unique identifier for each task, automatically generated by Django as a primary key.
- **todo_name:** A character field to store the title or name of the task, with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- **status:** A choice field to store the status of the task, with options including "not started", "in progress", and "completed".
- **user:** A foreign key field to store the user who created the task, linking the task to the User model.

##ToDo Views

The ToDo Views are responsible for handling the logic for each task-related action in the application. These views are defined in the **views.py** file and are called when a user interacts with the application.

Here are the Task Views defined in the **views.py** file:

**1. todo_list**

    - This view retrieves a list of all todo items from the database and renders the todo_list.html template, passing the list of todo items as a context variable.
    - The todo_list view is called when the user visits the root URL of the application ('').

**2. toggle_status**

    - This view takes an id parameter, which identifies the todo item to be updated.
    - The view toggles the completed status of the todo item and saves the changes to the database.
    - The toggle_status view is called when the user clicks the "Toggle Status" button for a todo item.

**3. delete_task**

    - This view takes an id parameter, which identifies the todo item to be deleted.
    - The view deletes the todo item from the database.
    - The delete_task view is called when the user clicks the "Delete" button for a todo item.

**4. update_task**

    - This view takes an id parameter, which identifies the todo item to be updated.
    - The view retrieves the todo item from the database, updates its details, and saves the changes to the database.
    - The update_task view is called when the user submits the "Update" form for a todo item.


**URL Routing**

The URL Routing system in Django maps URLs to views, which handle the logic for each page or action in the application. In the ToDo Genie application, the URL patterns are defined in the **urls.py** file.

In the ToDo Genie application, the **urls.py** file defines four URL patterns:

**Todo List Page:**
    -URL: '/'
    -View: 'todo_list'
    -Name: 'todo_list'
    -Function: Displays the list of tasks

**Toggle Task Status:**
    -URL: '/toggle_status/<int:id>/'
    -View: 'toggle_status'
    -Name: 'toggle_status'
    -Function: Toggles the status of a task

**Delete Task:**
    -URL: '/delete/<int:id>/'
    -View: 'delete_task'
    -Name: 'delete'
    -Function: Deletes a task

**Update Task:**
    -URL: '/update/<int:id>/'
    -View: 'update_task'
    -Name: 'update'
    -Function: Updates a task

By using URL Routing, the ToDo Genie application can decouple the URL structure from the view logic, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.
